The wide spectrum of versions and schemas supported by our **NDC aggregation Gateway** gives an idea of the flexibility and adaption capability of our technlogy which will allow us to adopt instantly airlines differenciated new NDC capabilities and versions.

We would like to say thanks to our deployment partners, [SITA](https://www.sita.aero/) and [Farelogix](https://www.farelogix.com/), for facilitating this certification process.

We are very much looking forward to bring more NDC-enabled airline partners on board on our aggregation platform.
