  We are really glad to announce our partnership with SITA, one of the most
  relevant IT companies in the airline industry
---

We are pleased to announce our recently inked agreement with [SITA](https://www.sita.aero/) to
collaborate in the creation of a set of NDC-related products for the airline
industry.

These products will help airlines distribute, manage, and analyze their NDC APIs more efficiently via technology that supports a wide range of NDC use cases.

We will disclose further details regarding this initiative shortly.

In the meantime, please feel free to contact us for more information.
