We proudly announce that United Airlines (UA) NDC content has been recently added to our platform once the certification process has been completed.

United is our second NDC-enabled US carrier distributing its content through our direct-distribution platform.

We constantly work on bringing the most and best content to our platform in order to achieve our purpose of being the best NDC and direct-connect aggregation platform in the industry.

Agencies that wish to get access UA's NDC content via AirGateway can start the application process on [United's NDC Onboarding form](http://united.com/ndc).
