We are glad to announce that we will be exhibiting our NDC Aggregation Gateway in the next [Travel Technology Europe Launchpad](http://www.traveltechnologyeurope.com) happening in London during the next 22nd and 23rd of February as a part of the [Business Travel Show conference](http://www.businesstravelshow.com).

We will be presenting our NDC aggregation service for TMCs, OTAs and consolidators. Any industry agent interested in learning more about the new direct distribution model impulsed by IATA and the airlines is very welcome to come to our deck where we will be happy to attend their questions.
