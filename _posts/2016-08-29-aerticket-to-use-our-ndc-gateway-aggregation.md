We are really glad to announce that [AERTiCKET](http://www.aerticket.de/), the biggest air travel retailer in Germany that claims to be more than a mere consolidator, will be integrating with our NDC Gateway service in order to adopt as fast and seamless as possible the NDC standard which is becoming the GDS-less channel between airlines and big retailers looking to enhance their direct connection.
We will be working closely with AERTiCKET in the next months in order to provide a satisfactory NDC aggregation experience.
