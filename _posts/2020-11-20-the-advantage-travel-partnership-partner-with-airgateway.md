The end-to-end solution for NDC ​will be available to Advantage members for no upfront cost.

London, XX November 2020 – The ​Advantage Travel Partnership, the UK’s largest independent travel agent and travel management company (TMC) consortium, has announced a partnership with AirGateway GmbH – a German B2B airline distribution company, to provide members complimentary New Distribution Capability (NDC) ​access to additional airline content.
There are no initial outlay costs for Advantage members, allowing members to have access to as much content as possible, to ensure they remain competitive and agile when the market returns.
AirGateway’s NDC Agency Desktop Tool, ​Booking Pad​ is an end-to-end solution for NDC, ready to be used by any certified IATA agency in the world. Currently providing access to more than 25 NDC-enabled airlines, granting access to their best deals, by avoiding the GDS surcharges and enabling extra revenues, by selling airline ancillaries.
Julia Lo Bue-Said, CEO, The Advantage Travel Partnership​ said: “​Given the changing face of airline distribution, this new partnership with AirGateway is of great importance to Advantage and our members. With many airlines changing strategies in the current environment, it is imperative our members have access to the greatest range of content as possible, to remain competitive and agile when the market returns.”
“This new partnership enhances our robust Advantage Airline programme, which gives all Advantage members the potential to currently access nett fares from around 50 airlines, from a list that is continually growing. Our nett fare programme provides both members and our airline partners with an efficient infrastructure to manage their airline nett fare content.”

Jorge Diaz, CEO ​AirGateway GmbH ​said: “Partnering with the largest consortium of independent travel agencies in the UK represents a great opportunity for AirGateway to serve a diverse and selected range of travel agencies in the British travel space. We are delighted to be part of this collaboration and to offer our technology solutions to jointly address the most complex and fragmented corporate travel market in Europe. This venture represents a great step forward in our effort to expand the adoption of the NDC distribution strategy in the intricate European Travel Market.”
With an increasing number of airlines charging for bookings made in the GDS channel, this platform allows Advantage members to avoid the direct distribution charges imposed by the airlines when booking through the GDS. Advantage members will be charged on a per booking basis with no commitment to volumes; allowing members to use the tool as little or as frequently as required.

   Airlines have been actively reducing the content available through the GDS channel for some time now, with members having access to AirGateway’s ​Booking Pad​, it will allow them access to additional and specific content for their travellers that is only available via NDC.
