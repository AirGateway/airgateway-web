We are happy to announce that have completed successfully the technical integration with [mTrip](https://www.mtrip.com/) in order to offer our customer agencies a streamlined onboarding and traveler management experience.

The Montreal-based company offers a range of traveler management solutions that can now play smoothly with reservations made through our advanced NDC-ready Booking Platform.

This integration applies to both of our [NDC Aggregated API](https://api.airgateway.net/v1.1/) Product and our [Agent Desktop Solution](https://bookingpad.info/).

If you want to learn more about how your travel agency can take advantage of this collaboration feel free to [contact us to schedule a demo](https://calendly.com/airgateway).
