We are launching our own Youtube channel where we will be posting video-tutorials and screencasts of our products in order to keep our customers informed about the new features we deploy on our products.

As an introduction we have released a sneak peek video of  [Bookingpad](https://bookingpad.net/), our NDC-enabled web agent desktop booking tool.
