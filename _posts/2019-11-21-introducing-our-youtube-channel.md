We are launching our own Youtube channel where we will be posting video-tutorials and screencasts of our products in order to keep our customers informed about the new features we deploy on our products.

As an introduction we have released a sneak peek video of  [**Bookingpad**](https://bookingpad.net/), our NDC-enabled web agent desktop booking tool.

You can now subscribe to [our Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmwFyV57gsV6OOL5j98qUTQ) or so that we will be pushing new screencasts as we add relevant features to our platform and products.
