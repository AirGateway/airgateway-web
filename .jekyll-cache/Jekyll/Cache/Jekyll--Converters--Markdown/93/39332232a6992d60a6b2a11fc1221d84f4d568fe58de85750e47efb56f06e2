<p>We have taken the time of the pandemic to review, rebuild, and relaunch our value-proposal for the TMCs that are looking for a new partner with whom to build their GDS-independent technology strategy for the next generation of managed corporate travel.</p>

<p>For this purpose we have focused our efforts on three levels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Product level: We are working on a set of features and services that enables TMCs to streamline their business workflows and establish a more efficient. The most relevant event in this roadmap is that we will be launching very soon (Q1 2021) our SBT/CBT allowing both travel requests and self-booking.</li>
  <li>Content level: In addition to our NDC content extended coverage, we have already added an LCC content provider (<a href="https://www.tripstack.com/">TripStack</a>), a multi-airline provider (<a href="https://www.hahnair.com/en">Hahn Air</a>) to our existing offering and we are working hard in our first GDS integration. (Soon to be disclosed).</li>
  <li>Partnerships level: We keep working hard in building down-stream integrations with more Mid/Backoffice partners in order to cover as much. We will be announcing soon our first partnerships in South Africa, the US, and the Nordic region.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, we have made our commercials <strong>crystal-clear and public</strong> in order to facilitate the TMCs understanding of the content distribution landscape, especially confusing and obfuscated when it comes to New Distribution Capability.</p>

<p>You can here get an overview of our pricing plans attending to TMCs sizing and requirements.</p>
